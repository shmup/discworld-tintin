reply Not to mention, playing around with the colors during generation. I'd like to invert the whole thing for _night viewing_ hehe
reply Oh! I probably built my own connection "obv knows the Moo, maybe was a part of _the Moo_"
reply That's actually one of my interests, making useful `things` for tt++ that leans on your db, querying X, pathing Y, but doesn't make a lot of decisions so it's easy to integrate w/ your stack
reply You've prob seen that fella who has done a lot of stuff with your sqlite.db and whatnot, but I do not like their work! 
reply abso-linking this on my page https://discworld.starturtle.net/external/atlas/amlist.htm
reply aw i love these old map! glad you linked me
reply everything is so coupled together, the UI and the functioniality
reply hm, mind if I pick your brain about something? Guess I won't ask to ask and will just ask: these lovely maps you've generated, the ones we use in the atlas wiki..
