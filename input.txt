1 "keep all in backpack"
1 (I put 50 bucks in it yesterday)
1 :cheers for Estie
1 :chuckles
1 :gives Noshoes permission to tent knock anytime
1 :has entered /r/pol
1 :hugs Valter
1 :keeps a tent flap open
1 :lights an incense and leans into Sunday
1 :who meeeees
1 Ah. I think it was my dad who taught me
1 Any other artist*
1 Anyone got a custom combat monitor string they would share so I can just see what you're into? :P
1 Anyone had fun with a tent timing out after the described "few days" ?
1 Are all takeout chinese joints using menus that are just a camera pic and poor quality? lol
1 Arilulaliley I'm not a parser expert but I am an expert in doing dumb stuff.. so I just use `keep` on everything at once heh
1 Baby steps towards a real home
1 But just Alice
1 Coming from Valter this is hehehe
1 Crunch once, shame on chair.. 
1 Crystal Castles?
1 Dink, you related to my horse, Donk?
1 Ello Valter
1 Fair no doubt
1 Feel that, if you like the chilly, go enjoy Minneapolis
1 Findlay, just south of Toledo
1 Haha Paracelsus
1 Hahaha
1 Have you ever seen the cops ep w/ the snake charmer? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7VNv-tIEM
1 Heh. I recently started sending everything on this computer to a cheap backblaze b2 
1 Hehe
1 Her having a brother here had extra gossip I'm sure.. 
1 Hi 419
1 I .. can.. have a village of tents?
1 I am just summoned back at least 16 years (evidently) bc of current 1's choice of music chater hehe
1 I am so thankful for these tents hehehe
1 I definitely appreciate the work! I do think quow's sqlite db should have a tool to interact with it, and then, used however/whever stdout is accepted hehe
1 I do love my alias categories
1 I don't know if you can really stick with Joanna long.. you just revisit for nostalgia and enjoy that
1 I just bought my first one, so I'm poorly reading the Users Manual
1 I mean, even Lanfear has a tip jar
1 I moved here from Ohieeeee
1 I only cloc'd it because I also wanted to see what this dude's ambitious tintin++ stack of dw scripts comes out to
1 I only this year started doing that with archive.org, checkin the box to recurse the page
1 I think I just abused 1 blonde redhead album
1 I will switch moods to dark tunes
1 I would never!
1 I'd avoid any other service that might shoot me an ad :P 
1 I'd tell the disc to choose what's for dinner but I just decided to call in chinese takeout
1 I'm gonna link a song/video I used to play a lottt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWSz_PAfgNc
1 I'm in Traverse City, and mostly consider leaving for Minneaplis if anywhere
1 Idk, whatever you'd want in the background when you're playing VTES or anything from whitewolf
1 If I think of that music I'm also going to go back to some stuff like Joanna Newsom <333
1 Is there a big home owning upkeep? Is it a PITA like IRL?
1 It's one of my favs
1 It's really nice, I don't even use it and I think it's a great achievement
1 Just to move
1 Just when they gave homes to the poor, someone wants to go and give bears a welcome mat
1 Lanfear, I can tell you already got it goin' on
1 Laundry day exceptions?
1 Link me vampire music, Valter
1 Love those wild and crazy guys
1 MT lol
1 Madonna is notoriously kinda weird/awful, right?
1 Moving on
1 My mid 2000's last.fm is actually not only diff, some of it is _embarrassing_ ok
1 My tent is still standing, phew. Good morning y'all
1 Nice try convincing us you don't have supernatural vision
1 Not today, Valter -- I'm here and not here, really
1 Oh I'm for sure going to be inhaling particulates today
1 Oh okie right right yos
1 Oh totally Rienen
1 Oh totally Rienne
1 Only if you want to exist in a city
1 Oops misread 
1 Or is your radius pretty wide heh
1 Peach, plum, pear
1 Pick something Melancholic https://cesspit.dungeon.red/i/UDUYXP.png
1 Quows stack comes in at ~33k lines. though cloc only sees the xml and not the embedded lua, so I don't get a real accurate metric here hehe
1 Rootin for ya to find a house that works
1 Sarah, this is club music. Club music is great, weren't you talkin  about NMH a bit ago haha
1 See ya Melancholic
1 Seems friendly
1 She had a homeless brother here for years, only passed just last year
1 She's no weirder than any other actor, that when visiting a town for the film fest, has every volunteer instructed to Not make eye contact with her. Just that stuff
1 Since the genesis of Valter
1 Since you linked YTM I will def click
1 So funny. Yeah I kept my 419 
1 Suppose I misread that and it's only the items dropped in/outside that time out after a few days
1 That also takes me back Melancholic
1 There you are. "Do I know you?" No, but that's where you are, you're there
1 There's actual features I like on ff, esp sending tabs to other devices that auto-open there
1 This is a bit too custom tailored for me, but it's been nice to study parts: https://code.tubul.net/tt_dw
1 This song is gonna make me stand up from desk for a bit
1 Timecheck (10p)
1 To sway
1 Ultimately it'll be a stir fry Melancholic
1 Valter, I can enjoy reality tv sometimes, which is a way of me saying I'm glad you're here
1 Very good for old web, do a "Discworld MUD" search, end up on Airk's page http://www.gothmudders.com/airk/index2.htm
1 Wait, you said relatively close! I just jumped the gun
1 Waiting for the sun to go down so my skin can relax and brain can go fuzzy
1 We can still listen to Alice if we want to
1 Well obv :( sorry to remind you
1 Well part 2 is looking at 1995qualitymenu.jpg and see if I'll try something Different
1 Well, there's extra XP to be gained if you hunt w/ a horse, cuz it'll help you smash much quicker :P
1 What about the one in OC?
1 What do the moving pictures on your eyelids tell you, Valter
1 Which is a ton of famous people right heh
1 Who taught you backgammon?
1 Wouldn't surprise me!!
1 Y'all lookin at homes in your area?
1 Ya I like atlasobscura too
1 Ya, I think they're manual at the moment, and the tar is a few years old
1 Yes, my tastes have changed :P
1 You are a thing and I love you
1 You don't sound bad at all
1 You may enjoy this search engine for random searches. Been gettin buzz off and on the past few years: https://search.marginalia.nu/
1 ac: $ifarg1: alias show sorted category $1$ $else$ frimble sparky is cool$endif$
1 and so, katy perry is mostly misunderstood?
1 as long as I'm procrastinating, I'm doing okay
1 b-b-b-bad? 
1 but may not be a _term_ like software has
1 does quow have a patreon :P
1 go to sleep in tent, log out. log in, outside of tent. Need to see a specialist on the disc about sleep walking
1 good call, I think I'm gonna trigger a new recursive update there later haha
1 gotta wrap it all useful like :P
1 hahahah Melancholic
1 howdy
1 i'll always remember sparky now
1 idk if it is, i mean, lambda calculus is kinda all about the concept
1 lanfera
1 mud wiki plz load. is there a mirror? 
1 no doubt no doubt
1 oh, procrastinating and staying distracted
1 pretend that my teeth are villains
1 rat romit
1 re: losing tent on restarts. I see uptime is 15 days. Any clue what the average uptime is?
1 right?
1 sparky gave me my ac alias
1 take quows sqlite db: add views, maybe but prob not indexes, and some very convenient queries to serve ur TUI needs
1 tbh, I misread "weird" re: madonna as "kinda shitty to casual people" 
1 that's so powerful too, "first class functions"
1 us tintin folks live in da shell
1 we get our fancy readline, respecting our inputrc and bindings, even when mudd'n hehe
1 we talkin to the bone levels here?
1 well, prob don't measure the LOC but it's a fun metric no doubt
1 wifefam++
1 yeah most of those are ~600 lines, that minimap.xml is 28k though
1 yep, may have an even dorkier name say in maths but it works for programmign heh

reply "The hospital I was born in has been destroyed/ruined/torn apart" lol
reply I was big into Myspace and aim profiles :P
reply It's silly is all, nothing to really get. An aesthetic and wordplay
reply Nice nice. Well _technically_ I did all my school in McComb Ohio, only mentioning it because .. god, if you know about "McComb" that'd be a MUD record for me
reply Not to mention, playing around with the colors during generation. I'd like to invert the whole thing for _night viewing_ hehe
reply Oh! I probably built my own connection "obv knows the Moo, maybe was a part of _the Moo_"
reply That's actually one of my interests, making useful `things` for tt++ that leans on your db, querying X, pathing Y, but doesn't make a lot of decisions so it's easy to integrate w/ your stack
reply Wow, that's a weird thought haha
reply You've prob seen that fella who has done a lot of stuff with your sqlite.db and whatnot, but I do not like their work! 
reply abso-linking this on my page https://discworld.starturtle.net/external/atlas/amlist.htm
reply aol instant messenger, you might wear your personality in your aim profile
reply aw i love these old map! glad you linked me
reply everything is so coupled together, the UI and the functioniality
reply hm, mind if I pick your brain about something? Guess I won't ask to ask and will just ask: these lovely maps you've generated, the ones we use in the atlas wiki..

war Also I want to put a shelf in that yurt
war Anyone compared sizes on any tents?
war Are you that other Ohio person too? The Columbusian
war Before I goof again, which camp would be open right now, and would a tent be there? I can't exactly tell what's what with calendar output
war Big fan of warriors, ug?
war Fernir chimed in and so I see what happened now
war Have my first one, it's for sure a [cramped tent]
war Hm. Okay then! i said the Ohio thing after your last msg in here, but didn't imply it was to you Felurian, re: Your heart is in Ohio
war I figured the item was not new, but the item now has a rich help file and some cooler .. properties
war I have a tent for the night, if there's just 1, go get it Felurian. I got mine at the Hunter camp near Lancre
war I need to get a route there, I can get my mount close to it I think
war I suspect that's the one you're thinkin of? I'm noob
war I want to go get myself a yurt.. anyone recall the price?
war I'm gonna see what it's like to leave things out and trust the world
war Is Felurian not Fernir?
war Some good details in the dev blog
war Someone was collecting 'em all one day. Don't forget the wizard hat for sale in.. AM?
