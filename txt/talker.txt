talker                        Discworld player help                       talker

Description
     The talker is a wonderful object that lets you communicate with people
     all over the Disc.  You can chat messages into the talker and everyone
     on the channel you are talking on (and who isn't ignoring you) will
     hear it.

     There are various methods of obtaining a talker.  One is by buying one
     or exchanging a voucher for one from a nearby shop:

     Ankh-Morpork             The magic shop on Filigree Street
                              Jorodin's on Short Street
                              Krazzander's on Cockbill Street
     Bes Pelargic             The shop opposite the Paper Dragon Inn on
                              Rhinu Road
     Djelibeybi               The tent on the east side of the bazaar
     Genua City               Heroic Endeavours in the city market
     Ephebe                   A man called Alethelegeios, who can be found
                              on the south pier of Ephebe.
     Il Drim                  The general store
     Lancre                   The general store
     Ohulan-Cutash            One of the market stalls
     Sto Lat                  The Royal Market

     Different places use different items as their talker.  In Ankh
     Morpork, you get a bracelet.  In Sto Lat, you get a wooden cabbage.
     In Bes Pelargic, you get a golden lemur.  In Djelibeybi and Il Drim,
     you get a scarab ring.  In Genua, you get a withered ear.  And in
     Ohulan-Cutash and Lancre, you get a wooden ring.

     For the following commands don't type chat in front. If you type "chat
     talker list" you probably won't get what you wanted, everyone else
     will hear you chat "talker list" and people will grin at you a lot.

     talker help              Gives a shorter and less detailed help file.
     talker on                Turns your talker on so you can hear and send
                              messages.  Also lets you then change
                              channels.
     talker off               Turns your talker off so you don't get any
                              messages.  Useful if you want some peace and
                              quiet.
     talker brief/verbose     These change how you see the talker messages
                              from others.  Brief makes the messages short
                              and verbose makes them longer but the basic
                              message stays the same in either form.
     talker channels          Shows you what channels you can be on and
                              what channels you are currently on.  What
                              channels are available to you depends on who
                              you are and what you have done.  Channel
                              "one" is available to everyone and is
                              generally the most popular but there are
                              other channels for guilds, religions,
                              organisations and other things.
     talker (channel)         This lets you listen to and chat on (channel
                              name).  You must type the channel name as
                              it's shown on "talker channels", e.g.
                              "talker wizards".
     talker delete (channel)  Takes you off (channel). You have to use the
                              channel name as it's shown on talker channels
                              here too.
                              e.g. "talker delete priests" or "talker
                              delete one".
     talker list              Shows who has a talker and what channels they
                              are on.  Anyone shown as (asleep) has their
                              talker off.
     talker history (channel) Shows you the last few chats on a channel.
                              Once again you must type the channel name
                              with capitals if "talker channels" has it
                              that way.
     talker echo on/off       Turn the local echo on or off.  If it's "on"
                              you can see your own chats.
     talker colour on         Turns colour support on for your talker.
     talker colour off        Turns colour support off for your talker.
     talker colour reset      Resets talker colours to their default
                              settings.
     talker colour (channel)  Sets a channel to a specific colour. You need
     (colour)                 to have set your terminal to support colour
                              for this to work though. See "help term". The
                              colour parameter specifies what colour the
                              channel will be. Valid colours are magenta,
                              red, yellow, green, blue, cyan and white.
                              You can also use bold to make the colour
                              bold. The channel name "default" is used to
                              set the colour for any other channels you
                              have.
     talker alias add <chan>  Give the channel an alias.
     as <alias>
     talker alias delete      Delete a channel alias.
     <alias>
     talker alias list        Show all your current channel aliases.
     talker one prompt on/off Turns the display of "(One)" in front of
                              chats on channel One on or off (e.g. on:
                              (one) Feantur wisps: Ook!, off: Feantur
                              wisps: Ook!).

Chatting
     These commands are for sending messages and don't have talker in
     front.  The channel name you type is in the aliased name or the real
     name if you have no alias:

     (channel) (message)      Type the channel name in *lower case* to send
                              a message to everyone on that channel.  You
                              need to be on a channel before you can talk
                              on it. e.g. Froggy types "two I am a blue
                              frog!" Everyone else will see - (Two)
                              Froggy's wispy voice comes from the bracelet
                              saying : I am a blue frog!
     chat (message)           Will send (message) to channel one if you are
                              on it.
     chat :(emote)            Will send (emote) to the channel.  e.g.
                              Froggy types "chat :is a blue frog!" Everyone
                              else will see - (one) Froggy wisps that he is
                              a blue frog!

     (channel) :(emote)       Will send (emote) to the channel. e.g. Froggy
                              types "two :is a blue frog!" Everyone else
                              will see - (Two) Froggy wisps that he is a
                              blue frog!
