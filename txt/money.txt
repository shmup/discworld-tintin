CONVERT                       Discworld player help                      CONVERT
{{{
Name
     convert - Convert measurement units

Syntax
     convert <amount> <units> to <other units>
     convert time <days> days <hours> hours <minutes> minutes to <world>
     convert money <money> {in|from} <place> {to|in} <place>

Description
     This command does unit conversion for you, so the rest of the world
     can tell what those silly Americans are talking about and vice versa.
     The units that can be converted are:

     Length:      inches (in), feet (ft), yards (yd), rods,
                  smoots, furlongs (fur), miles (mi),
                  meters/metres (m)
     Area:        acres (ac), hectares (ha), square length
                  units
     Volume:      fluid ounces (fl oz), gills (gi), cups (c),
                  pints (pt), quarts (qt), gallons (gal),
                  hogsheads (hhd), liters/litres (l, L),
                  cubic length units
     Weight:      ounces (oz), pounds (lb), stones (st),
                  tons, gems, debens (db), Discworld pounds
                  (dw lb), grams (g)
     Time:        seconds (sec, s), minutes (min), hours
                  (hr), days, weeks, fortnights, years (yr)
     Temperature: celcius/celsius (C), fahrenheit (F)

     (Yes, we know grams are mass, not weight, but we are making the
     possibly dangerous assumption that you live somewhere near the surface
     of the planet Earth.)

     The abbreviations for temperatures use the capital C and the capital
     F.  This is actually case sensitive.

     Square length units may be used as for areas, and cubic length units
     maybe be used for volumes.  For example "convert 50 square feet to
     square meters" or "convert 10 cubic feet to pints".  "Square" may be
     abbreviated "sq" or "sq." or you can attach a suffix of "2" or "^2" on
     the units, as "miles2" or "in^2".  Similarly, "cubic" may be
     appreviated "cu" or "cu.", or you can use a "3" or "^3" suffix on the
     unit.

     By default all volume measures are Imperial units.  If you want the
     version used in the United States, put a "US" in front of it, eg, US
     fluid ounces.  The hogshead used in this command is the US wine
     hogshead, which is equivalent to 63 US gallons.

     One smoot is equal to 5 feet, 7 inches.  See also:
     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot

     The years used in this command are mean tropical years of 365.24218967
     days.  The miles are international statute miles of 5280 international
     feet, or precisely 1.609344 km.

     You can also use this command to convert rates, eg, miles per hour to
     meters per second.  Any of the unit groups can be used in either
     place.

     The metric prefixes between milli- on the small end and kilo- on the
     big end are recognized as are their abbreviations.  Prefixes will work
     with both metric and English units.  This means you can do things like
     convert 150 US fluid milliounces per second to hectoliters per hour,
     which is silly, but then, this is Discworld.

     Due to the limitations of the underlying mathematics, conversions that
     result in very large or very small numbers may not be completely
     accurate.  For example, the result of converting the speed of light to
     furlongs per fortnight will be slightly off from the actual value.

Time
     With the 'convert time' syntax, the command can give an amount of
     Discworld time in the Roundworld, or vice versa.

Money
     With the 'convert money' syntax, various amounts of Discworld
     currencies can be converted to their value in other currencies.  The
     amount of money should be in the format given by 'money' or 'money
     brief' in order to be parsable.

Examples
     > convert 26 celcius to fahrenheit
     78.8000003

     > convert 80 F to C
     26.666668

     > convert 186000 miles per second to kilometers per hour
     1077616896.000000

     Abe Simpson exclaims loudly: My car gets forty rods to the hogshead, and
     that's the way I likes it!

     > convert 40 rods/hhd to mi/US gal
     0.001984

     Presto wisps: I must've drank 10 pints of beer last night. :(

     > convert 10 US pints to pints
     8.326738

     > smirk presto

     > convert money 2 Agatean Empire ten-rhinu from cwc to am
     20Rh is worth A$24.

     > convert time 3 days 4 hours 42 minutes to roundworld
     3 days, 4 hours and 42 minutes on the Disc is 23 hours and 36 seconds in
     the real world.

     Genua
     > 1,2,3,4Gd
     The first number is the amount of Genua ducats, the second forins, the
     third livres and the fourth cents (from left to right this would be 1
     ducat, 2 forins, 3 livres and 4 cents).  The highest coin type will be
     displayed with its symbol of either Gd, Gf, Gl or Gc (where ducat > forin >
     livre > cents).  E.g. if you have a ducat, it will display Gd etc.

     Lancre
     > LH 1|2|3|4|5 1/4
     That is 1 Lancre hedgehog, 2 Lancre sovereigns, 3 Lancre crowns, 4 Lancre
     shillings and 5 Lancre pennies and 1 Lancre farthing, notated as 1/4 of a
     penny (see section Values).  The base for Lancre coinage is 12, with each
     major denomination (seperated by "|" in brief form) being worth twelve
     times the amount of the next lower denomination.  For example, 1 shilling =
     12 pennies, and so forth.

MAKING MONEY             Discworld Getting Started Help             MAKING MONEY
{{{
Name
     Making Money - Some tips to get your purse full.

Introduction
     Early on, making money can be quite challenging.  But don't worry:
     once your skills are a little higher and you know a bit more about the
     ways of the Disc, getting enough money becomes much easier.  This help
     file will go over some common methods to make money.  Some may be
     possible for you already, while others may not be.

Loot
     Looting the money and equipment from slain NPCs, and then selling it
     to a general store, is arguably the most common form of income.  A
     pack or sack to store your loot is recommended, and it is a good idea
     to try and learn what items sell for the most money.  If your skills
     are too low to kill loot-laden NPCs on your own, you may be able to
     group with other players and divide the loot.

     It's a good idea to keep an eye on how burdened you are due to the
     loot you're carrying, as this can have a significant impact on your
     combat abilities.  Sell loot before you get too burdened, and perhaps
     deposit the money that you don't immediately need at a bank; large
     amounts of coins can weigh a lot.

Scavenging
     Using the "search" command on city streets can turn up all kinds of
     items - from loose change to damaged equipment and vermin such as rats
     and cockroaches.  Equipment can be used or sold, while vermin can be
     killed for XP even if your combat skills are very low.  If you're
     lucky, you may even find something quite valuable while searching!

     Older players may not bother to loot the corpses of NPCs they kill
     very thoroughly.  If the killer has moved on or given you permission
     to loot the corpse, you may be able to grab some loot for yourself.
     You can use the "recover" command to dig up buried corpses, but
     remember to "bury" them again once you're done.  Note that it is
     impolite to loot a corpse of an NPC which you did not kill without
     permission!

     Items which are in good condition will sell for more than those which
     are damaged.  It may be worth repairing things before selling them, if
     you're able.

Theft & Fencing
     If you have the appropriate skills and commands, you may be able to
     steal items from shops or NPCs.  Before you do so, you should be aware
     of the laws and penalties which surround this in the city you're in.
     Items which have been stolen can not be sold at general stores; they
     must be fenced.

     A fence is an NPC who will buy items from you, often for more than a
     general store will offer.  Fences can be found around the Disc, and
     may offer better prices for the types of items they specialise in.

Jobs
     Some cities on the Disc offer "jobs", in which you perform a service
     for an NPC in exchange for money and sometimes even some XP.  While
     they are similar to quests, jobs can be repeated and will not give you
     any quest points or creator cards.

     Some jobs require certain skills, equipment or guild membership.
     Example jobs include repairing streets for the job market in
     Ankh-Morpork, delivering meals in Bes Pelargic, performing repairs or
     delivering parcels in Genua, and escort duty in Djelibeybi.

Services
     There is money to be made in providing services to other players.
     Some example services include enchanting items, providing
     transportation, delivering items, scribing magical scrolls or creating
     magical artifacts.  Many services rely on having certain skills and
     guild-specific abilities.  Player-established clubs exist to
     coordinate services.

     Other services do not require in-game skills, such as writing for one
     of the player-run newspapers, assisting a player-shop owner in
     acquiring rare stock or helping players to carry heavy furniture
     items.  Be imaginative and you might even find your own little niche
     in the economy!

     This command understands addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication
     (*) and division (/).  The normal order of operations is used, ie,
     multiplication and division, then addition and subtraction.
     Parentheses may be used to force things to be evaluated before other
     things.  There are also a number of mathematical functions included,
     as follows:

     sin( x )       The sine of the angle x, in radians.
     cos( x )       The cosine of the angle x, in radians.
     tan( x )       The tangent of the angle x, in radians.
     asin( x )      The arcsine of a number x between -1 and 1.
     acos( x )      The arccosine of a number x between -1 and 1.
     atan( x )      The arctangent of a number x.
     sqrt( x )      The square root of the number x.
     floor( x )     The greatest integer lower than x.
     ceil( x )      The lowest integer greater than x.
     round( x )     The integer closest to x.
     pow( x, y )    x to the power of y.
     exp( x )       e to the power of x.
     log( x )       The natural logarithm of x.

Description
     This command shows you how much money you are carrying.  When used
     with no arguments, the command shows all types of money.  If an area
     name is given, only money of that type will be displayed.  The
     "provincial" money (ie brass, copper, silver, gold, platinum) is
     always displayed.  If you ONLY want these types, use "money default".

Note
     In the past there have been bugs when money is put in containers, and
     it should not be considered as safe as using banks.  Money stored in
     vaults will in general not be replaced if it is lost due to bugs.

Example
