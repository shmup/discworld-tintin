The range of tents available has been expanded, and you can now go camping
around the Disc! Some highlights:

* Erecting a tent will keep the room it's in loaded, which means that the stuff
  you leave in it (and outside it) will not be eaten by the inevitable progress
  of time for a few days - even if you log out.

* WARNING: It can still be picked up by players or NPCs, and a crash or
  a reboot will destroy it all. Anything you lose like this will not be
  replaced by Liaisons.

* You will need to re-visit your tent at least once a Discworld week to shore
  it up, or it will fall down and you will lose your stuff. Looking at it will
  show you how badly it needs shoring up.

* There are some rooms (mostly in cities) where you won't be able to erect
  a tent. You also will not be able to erect a tent in the same room as another
  tent, whether a player tent or an NPC one.

* You will be able to find tents wherever the old wizards' tent hats were sold,
  in some of the warriors' guild shops, and in the Ankh-Morpork thieves' guild
  shop. If you already have a tent hat, you should be able to continue using
  it.

* Campfire kits are also available - once you unpack it you won't be able to
  move the campfire, but you can light or extinguish it as much as you like
  provided you have fuel.

* Both tents and campfire kits have their own help files!

* Have fun, and be happy campers!
