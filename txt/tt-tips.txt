Put this in your vimrc. Now you can use ^n and %p or arrows to search
through your history.

This means, if you simply press it w/o typing anything, it'll go
backwards in history order.

If you start to type something, say, "alias", then it'll only show
input that starts with "alias".

$if mode=emacs
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward
"\C-p": history-search-backward
"\C-n": history-search-forward
$endif


Now pair this with much better history in your tintin config:

#event {SESSION CONNECTED} {
  #history read input.txt;
};

#event {SESSION DISCONNECTED} {
  #history write input.txt;
};
