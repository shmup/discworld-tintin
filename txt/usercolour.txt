Usercolour                    Discworld player help                   Usercolour


Description
     Usercolour can be used in titles set with a title changer, the
     Scolorid's Scintillating Scribbling spell, tricks, illusions, and some
     other user input.  This file explains how to embed usercolour
     sequences in text.  Other players will only see usercolour if they
     enable the relevant output option and have a suitable terminal type
     defined.

     Usercolour sequences use a two character code of the percent character
     '%' followed by the caret character '^' (%^) to signal to the mud that
     it should generate coloured output.  This two character code is then
     combined with usercolour options to indicate that the following text
     should be coloured, or with "reset" to reset coloured output.

     A usercolour sequence contains of one or more usercolour options,
     preceded, separated and followed by the %^ character pair.  Options
     include foreground and background colours, bold, underline and blink.

     The general form is %^OPTION%^, then some text, then %^RESET%^.  There must
     be no spaces in usercolour sequences.  Using a reset after the coloured text
     is essential to turn off the coloured output.

An Example
     The following paragraph contains the text "%^BOLD%^RED%^This is bold red text.%^RESET%^".

     This is bold red text.

     Colours, backgrounds, modifiers and reset must be entered in upper
     case.  In general it does not matter which order you list a
     combination of foreground, background and modifiers.  When combining
     multiple usercolour options, a single %^ code between options is
     sufficient.

     If you wish to turn off an option, you need to use a reset and then
     re-activate all the otions you wish to remain active.  For example
     %^BOLD%^RED%^Librarian: %^RESET%^RED%^Not a monkey!%^RESET%^
     generates the text: Librarian: Not a monkey!
