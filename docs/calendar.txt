Name
     calendar - show the Discworld days for the coming Roundworld week

Syntax
     calendar

Description
     The calendar command lists which Discworld days will occur on which
     real life days for the coming week.

     Note that one Discworld day equals slightly more than 7 hours in "real
     life".

     The output of the calendar command can be confusing if you don't know
     anything about the Discworld year so here are the very basics:

     A Discworld common year has 400 days and 13 months; it covers the
     usual seasons spring, summer, autumn and winter. Two common years
     (called Prime and Secundus) form a Discworld astronomical year (ie,
     the time it takes for the Disc to make one complete turn).

     For example, the 21st Grune Secundus UC 2030 is the 21st day of the
     month Grune in the second common year of the astronomical year 2030.

     The Discworld seasons are:
     Spring Prime
     Summer Prime
     Autumn Prime
     Spindlewinter
     Spring Secundus
     Summer Secundus
     Autumn Secundus
     Backspindlewinter

     The Discworld months are:
     Offle          32 days
