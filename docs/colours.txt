Description
     Discworld allows you to customise the colours in which various kinds
     of texts are displayed.  This is done primarily through the "options"
     system.

     To see your current colour settings, use "options colour"; further
     colour settings are in "options colour club" (for individual club
     channels), "options colour inform" (for informs you have enabled using
     the "inform" command), and so on.

     To change a colour setting, use: "options colour <event> = <colour>".
     This will set all future messages of type <event> to be displayed in
     the colour <colour>.  Instead of a colour, you can set the value to
     "default" to let the game choose a colour for messages of the given
     type), or "none" to have them displayed without colour.

     The colour settings for talker channels are tied to the object you use
     as a talker (so you will have to set them again if you replace your
     talker).  To enable colour on your talker, use "talker colour on".  To
     see the colour settings for your talker, use "talker colour list".  To
     change the colour for a channel, use "talker colour <channel>
     <colour>".

The Basic Colours
     Depending on your client and terminal type, there are many colour
     options available.  The eight basic colours which nearly all clients
     support are:
          red
          magenta
          icterine
          green
          blue
          cyan
          white (white)
          black (black)

     Additional modifiers (which MUD clients often do not fully support)
     are:
          bold
          italic
          flash
          underline
     Modifiers and colours can be combined, giving for instance bold red or
     italic underline cyan.  For historical reasons, the colour yellow is
     simply an alias for bold icterine.

     In addition, most clients allow the use of background colours.  These
     can be addressed as b_red, b_magenta and so on.  Background colours
     cannot be made bold.

Further Colours
     Most modern clients have more extensive colour support.  For these
     clients, we have added some further colours, for example: lightblue,
     lightyellow, darkgreen, darkcyan, deepmagenta, deepwhite and so on,
     orange, rose, chartreuse, violet, azure, springgreen, grey, gold,
     silver, copper, bronze, brass, purple, pink, brown, khaki, ecru,
     beige, jade, turquoise, olive, lilac, mint, vermilion, sage,
     goldenrod, lime, teal, maroon, aquamarine, orchid, puce, topaz,
     emerald, cobalt, crimson, and many more.  The complete list of
     available colour names can be found in the helpfile:

          help colour list

     In addition, you can use hexadecimal codes, for example #FFBF00 or
     B_#004225.

     (NOTE: if these colours just look like the basic eight and their bold
     versions to you, you are most likely on term ansi.  Sometimes players
     have this setting even when their client also supports more colours;
     try setting "term network" to let your client inform us of its
     preferences.)

Examples
     > options colour
     shout      [BOLD]
     tell       [YELLOW]
     say        [CYAN ITALIC]
     whisper    [CYAN]
     soul       [TURQUOISE]
     emote      [#FEBDEE]
     remote     default
     exits      default
     inventory  default
     weather    default
     playername [B_#00ffd7 yellow]

     > options colour tell = jade underline
     Colour for tell set to jade underline.

     > options colour inform
     Logon      [YELLOW]
     Birthday   default

     > options colour inform logon=blue
     Logon colour set to [blue].

     > options colour club the_discworld_free_love_society=bold red
     The Discworld Free Love Society set to [bold red]

Extras
     Players can also set colours in titles set with a title changer,
     tricks, their refer and some other user input.  This is explained in:

          help usercolour

     To see any such user set colours (including your own!) that do not go
     through the options or talker colour control, use the options output
     usercolour option.

          > options output usercolour=on

     The final colour codes to mention are: ansired, ansigreen, ansiyellow,
     ansibold, ansiitalic, b_ansiblue, b_ansimagenta and so on (but only
     for the ansi colours and the modifiers), as well as ansireset.  These
     "colours" are used as overrides: they are ignored on a terminal with
     256 or more colours, but have the expected value on ansi terminals.
     This may be used by players who usually play from a client with
     extensive colour support, but occasionally swap to an alternative
     which only supports term ansi.

     For example, the colour azure is normally displayed as cyan on an ansi
     terminal.  The alternative colour group azure ansiblue ansibold is
     displayed as azure when viewed on a client with 256-colour support,
     but as bold blue when using term ansi.

     To see how a colour will look: use "colours test <colour>".  To see
     how it will look on an ansi- or xterm256-terminal, use "colours test
     ansi <colour>" or "colours test xterm <colour>" respectively.  For
     example:

          > colours test azure ansiblue ansibold
          > colours test ansi azure ansiblue ansibold
