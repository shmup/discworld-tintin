Description
     Nicknames are used to refer to objects by a nickname.  To use it, you
     just setup a nickname for any object by typing "nickname lynscar as
     lyn" or whatever.  To use the nickname, just put the nickname in any
     command where you would normally put the object's entire name.
     "unnickname" is used to delete a nickname.  "nickname" with no
     parameters will list all the nicknames you have currently defined.

Caution
     Nicknames are quite often the cause for commands, spells and rituals
     to stop working the way they should.  For instance, a "nickname
     redjack as red" will make it impossible to cast any spells or rituals
     that require you to have a red candle.  Likewise, "nickname annabel as
     an" will mess up (amongst many other things) Pragi's Fiery Gaze
     because you need *an* eye to cast that spell.  Always consider if a
     nickname could cause problems.

Deleting Nicknames.
     To delete nicknames, simply use dnickname or unnickname.
